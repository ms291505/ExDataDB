# introduction

This project is a simple database of exercises that a user can navigate using a website. This was created by me to learn how to publish a web application using React and ASP.NET Core on Azure, and as an introduction to working with SQL Server. I have years of experience writing queries for SQL Server but have never administered or written to a SQL Server database. This also turned into my introduction to using Docker, since I needed a way to run a development database locally on my Mac.

The exercise data come from an open source json file in the [Free Exercise DB](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db/tree/main) repository. I accessed this and created a copy of the json file on 2026-01-31. The repository also includes images, which I may include in my project in the future.
